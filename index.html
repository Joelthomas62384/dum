                <p>We believe that the best healer is the person who is afflicted and who is experiencing the discomforts of a body struggling to correct itself. The healer should prepare the space and provide the time to listen.</p>

            <h3>Welcome to <span>Nature Life International</span></h3>
            <p>The small seed of thought was based on the years of action that the originator of this movement Jacob Vadakanchery had starting from his native village of Vypeen which was based on Gandhiji’s concept of Svaraj and self reliant life. The Father of the Nation envisioned a life based on the essential confidence and pride of being independent and in control of one’s own body and mind. To be in tune with the essential natural balance of the human body he evolved a special system of Nature Cure that is also our leading light.</p>
